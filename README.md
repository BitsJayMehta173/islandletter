# Developing a book library which uses the letter curves to make a dictionary for each letter

I am trying to compress books data with the help of curves as we know the curves of letters are same and if we minimize the curves we are replacing letter with curves.

We can imporve the compression algorithms with signal curves too.

Developing Compression Ideas with other fields help


First Convert book page image to greyscale then convert the image into red and black now use island finding algorithm and scan each letter one by one
